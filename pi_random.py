# This code draws ntot points in a square of side two centered in the origin of the cartesian plane.
# For each point, we check if it falls within the unit circle. 
# From the ratio between the number of points within the unit circle and the total number of points we can estimate pi.
import numpy as np
ntot =  # yuu can 
x,y=np.random.uniform(-1,1,2)
if # complete the test to check if the point is within the circle

print("Using %i random points, the estimate of pi is: %" %(ntot,))
